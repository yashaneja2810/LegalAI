## ⚠️ **Pending: Testnet Deployment**

### Current Blocker: Wallet Funding

**Wallet Address:** `0x7E5F4552091A69125d5DfCb7b8C2659029395Bdf`  
**Network:** Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)  
**Current Balance:** ~0.000000000000024372 ETH  
**Required:** 0.001 ETH minimum  

### 🚰 **Get Testnet Funds:**

1. **Base Sepolia Faucet:** https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
2. **Sepolia Bridge:** https://sepoliafaucet.com/ → https://bridge.base.org/
3. **Alchemy Faucet:** https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia

### 🤖 **Automated Monitoring Active**

A monitoring script is running that will automatically deploy the contract once sufficient funds are detected.

---

## 📋 **Environment Configuration Needed**

### Frontend `.env.local` (Create this file):

```env
# Contract Addresses (will be updated after deployment)
NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_BASE_SEPOLIA=<PENDING_DEPLOYMENT>

# Network URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://sepolia.base.org

# WalletConnect Project ID 
# Get from: https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

# Environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV=development
```

### Backend Environment (Optional):
If you want to add backend integration later, you'll need to configure the backend with the deployed contract address.

## 🧪 **Testing Plan**

### Post-Deployment Tests (Ready to Execute):

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - [ ] Connect MetaMask to Base Sepolia
   - [ ] Connect Coinbase Wallet to Base Sepolia  
   - [ ] Connect WalletConnect to Base Sepolia

2. **File Processing**
   - [ ] Upload PDF document
   - [ ] Upload image file
   - [ ] Upload text document
   - [ ] Test multiple file upload
   - [ ] Verify hash generation

3. **Blockchain Interaction**
   - [ ] Gas estimation display
   - [ ] Transaction submission
   - [ ] Transaction confirmation tracking
   - [ ] Explorer link verification
   - [ ] Error handling for insufficient funds

4. **Document Verification**
   - [ ] Verify by hash input
   - [ ] Verify by file upload
   - [ ] Test with non-existent documents
   - [ ] Test with verified documents

## 🚀 **Deployment Commands (Ready)**

### Automatic Deployment (Recommended):
```bash
cd blockchain
./deploy-testnet.sh
```

### Manual Deployment:
```bash
cd blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network base-sepolia
```

### Start Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Open: http://localhost:3000/notary
```

## 📊 **Expected Post-Deployment Results**

### Contract Deployment:
- ✅ Contract address on Base Sepolia
- ✅ Verification on BaseScan
- ✅ Gas usage: ~390,693 (≈$0.007 USD)
- ✅ Deployment files generated

### Frontend Integration:
- ✅ Contract address updated in configuration
- ✅ Network connection to Base Sepolia
- ✅ End-to-end functionality working

### Generated Files:
- `blockchain/deployments/base-sepolia-84532.json`

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Guide**

### Common Issues:

1. **"Network not supported"**
   - Ensure wallet is connected to Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)
   - Check if Base Sepolia is added to your wallet

2. **"Contract not found"**
   - Verify contract address in `.env.local`
   - Check if deployment was successful

3. **Gas estimation failed**
   - Ensure wallet has sufficient Base Sepolia ETH
   - Check network connection

4. **Transaction failed**
   - Verify gas settings
   - Check wallet connection
   - Ensure contract is deployed
