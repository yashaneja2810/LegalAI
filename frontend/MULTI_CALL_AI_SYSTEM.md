# 🚀 Enhanced Multi-Call OpenAI System

This document explains how the advanced AI document generation system works with multiple OpenAI API calls for superior results.

## 🔄 Three-Step Process

### Step 1: 📊 User Prompt Analysis
- **AI Model**: GPT-4
- **Purpose**: Extract structured data from natural language
- **Input**: User's description + Business context
- **Output**: JSON with extracted fields (company name, candidate name, salary, dates, etc.)

### Step 2: ⚙️ Enhanced System Prompt Generation
- **Process**: Dynamic prompt creation based on extracted data
- **Purpose**: Create highly specific instructions for document generation
- **Result**: Customized system prompt aligned to user's exact requirements

### Step 3: 📄 Document Generation
- **AI Model**: GPT-4
- **Input**: Enhanced system prompt + Business context + Extracted data
- **Output**: Professional, legally compliant document

## 🎯 Extraction Capabilities

### Employment Contracts
- ✅ Company Name
- ✅ Candidate/Employee Name
- ✅ Position/Job Title
- ✅ Salary Amount
- ✅ Start Date
- ✅ Work Location
- ✅ Employment Type (Full-time/Part-time/Contract)
- ✅ Probation Period
- ✅ Benefits Package
- ✅ Working Hours
- ✅ Reporting Structure
- ✅ Special Clauses (Non-compete, IP, etc.)

### GST Returns
- ✅ Business Name
- ✅ GST Number/GSTIN
- ✅ Return Period
- ✅ Turnover Amount
- ✅ Taxable Supplies

## 💡 Smart Defaults

When information is not provided in the user prompt, the system intelligently:

1. **Uses Business Context**: Company details from the editor content
2. **Applies Industry Standards**: Default probation periods, working hours, etc.
3. **Adds Placeholders**: `[EMPLOYEE NAME]`, `[SALARY AMOUNT]` for manual completion
4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensures all documents meet Indian law requirements

## 🎨 User Experience

### Input Example:
```
"Create employment contract for Priya Sharma as CTO. 
Salary ₹25 LPA, start March 1, equity options, 
remote work allowed, reports to CEO."
```

### Extracted Data:
```json
{
  "candidateName": "Priya Sharma",
  "position": "Chief Technology Officer",
  "salary": "₹25 LPA", 
  "startDate": "March 1",
  "benefits": "equity options",
  "workLocation": "remote work allowed",
  "reportingTo": "CEO"
}
```

### Generated Document:
- Professional employment contract
- All extracted details incorporated
